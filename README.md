# Complex-Networks
Community detection in Complex Networks through modularity optimisation. (Simulated Annealing)
With NetworkX (Python library)

  1. Download a network from the network repository.
  2. Visualize the network + Summary statistics of the network ( degree distribution, clustering coefficient)
  3. Code to optimize modularity through simulated annealing for the problem of splitting the network in TWO communities
  4. Compare the outcome with the best partition provided by different software packages.
